# Split

## Overview

Do you also hate propriatery serrvices that need accounts, have ads and generally annoy you with subscriptions just to split some expenses? Me, too. Therefore this is the backend you need!

## How to Run

### Create a .env file in the project root and set these variables

```bash
# Postgres
PGUSER=
PGPASSWORD=
PGDATABASE=
PGPORT=
```

#### Run this

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```


#### Features planned until release:

- [ ] Full OpenAPI specs and have the models generated by it
- [ ] Find a solution for the graphing problem -> probably caching? maybe even worth it to delete everything and then readd?
- [ ] At the very least support users, groups and adding expenses to them -> then expand for more information needed for pretty things in the front end?
- [ ] Add JWT Auth with ECC
